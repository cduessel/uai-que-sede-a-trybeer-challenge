# Welcome to UAI, QUE SEDE! The trybeer challenge of Trybe Programing School

originally submitted @ https://github.com/tryber/sd-05-project-trybeer-v2/

This challenge consisted in a beer delivery app including a client and the seller/admin logged areas with lots of specs like a chat between clients and vendor, order/sale status management and, obviously, the shopping cart/purchase-flow itself.

The Front-end was developed with REACT.js and the Back-end with Node.js with mongoDB and mySQL databases.
